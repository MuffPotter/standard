What is StandardFX
==================
The Standard project is a collection of .NET libraries that aims to supplement, standardize and enhance the default 
implementation by Microsoft and popular third party solutions.

It all started when we started using .NET technology for our inhouse developments. While there were many amazing stuff 
in .NET that we like, many times we find ourselves writing repeated code. Snipplets and many excellent third party 
libraries helped, but things quickly got messy when you integrate lots of libraries written by different people. It works, 
but it is not satisfying.

So we started looking into the source code from the open source community, and try to learn from the best of minds. 
Sometimes we find that we can rewrite two different libraries into a coherent whole, with modules that both can share. 
Even better, there are times when we can swap part of other libraries for our own and get a boost out of performance. In
time, everything falls into place, and StandardFX is born.
